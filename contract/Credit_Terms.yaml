    title: 'Terms and Conditions for Credit Authorized by Stock and Foil'
    text: >-
      When executing a Tally Agreement with each other, the Client and Vendor each decide the amount of credit they will extend to the other Party.
      They may also specify parameters that influence how and when the debt will be satisfied.
      Those parameters are referred to generally as Credit Terms.
      Such terms can be specified by the Vendor to be applied by credit issued by the Client.
      They can also be specified by the Client to be applied by credit issued by the Vendor in such cases where the Tally may develop a negative balance.
      The various credit terms are defined as follows:
    sections:
      -
        title: 'Maximum Balance'
        text: >-
          This indicates the most the Issuer can count on borrowing against Product it obtains from the Recipient.
          The balance may be expressed as a single number, or as an expression, which is a function of time.
          Expressions may be used to amortize a loan, requiring principal to be paid down over time.
      -
        title: 'Maximum Paydown'
        text: >-
          This specifies the most the Issuer can pay down principal in advance of otherwise prevailing requirements and have his interest calculations reduced accordingly.
          This can be used to create a minimum interest return for a Recipient, while still allowing the Issuer to store value in the loan balance.
      -
        title: 'Compound Interval'
        text: >-
          The amount of time that passes before interest is calculated and applied to a balance.
          This may also define when payments are due.
          For example, if the application of such a charge raises a balance above the Maximum Balance, some kind of Lifting will have to occur to correct this.
      -
        title: 'Grace Period'
        text: >-
          New amounts of indebtedness will not accrue interest charges until this amount of time has passed.
      -
        title: 'Rate'
        text: >-
          An annualized rate expressed as a positive floating point number.
          For example, 0.05 means 5% per annum.
          This number will be scaled to match the Compound Interval in order to compute the interest/dividend charges to be applied during that an interval.
      -
        title: 'Call Notice'
        text: >-
          The amount of notice required to be given by Recipient to the Issuer in order to require all principal and accrued charges due and payable.
          If not present, the Issuer has no obligation to reduce principal any faster than is indicated by the Minimum Payment.
          The Call Notice is triggered by affixing a signed Call to the tally.
          The debt must be satisfied within the specified number of days after the date of the Call.
          For a fully amortizing debt, a Recipient would register an immediate call, with the number of notice days set to the term of the amortization.
      -
        title: 'Minimum Payment'
        text: >-
          An amount, or a formula for the smallest amount that may be paid at each Compound Interval.
