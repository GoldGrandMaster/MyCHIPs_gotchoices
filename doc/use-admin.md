## Connecting the Admin UI
(The harder way)  
Once you have a MyCHIPs server running, you can try connecting to the 
SPA (possibly from another machine) by directing your browser to:
```
https://<hostname>:8000/admin.html
```
  Your browser will likely warn you of an insecure site.  
  For testing, you may be able to just proceed anyway.  Better yet, the
  "npm initcerts" command executed previously will have created a certificate in pki/local/web-ca.crt 
  (or test/docker/pki/web-ca.crt for a docker test instance).
  If you tell your os/browser you trust that CA, you can proceed without warnings.
  
  See [this section](use-pki.md) for more details about securing your site with
  an SSL certificate (whether you use a commercial certificate or make your own).
  
  If the connection is working, you should see an open connection dialog in the 
  upper right corner of the app.

- You will need a ticket to initialize the connection.  In the step above, a
  ticket was created in (by default): test/local/admin.json.
  If it hasn't expired yet, you can use it now.
  
  Otherwise, you need to generate a new one so do that now:
```  
    npm run adminticket			#or:
    npm run adminticket -- -H hostname -P port -o ticket_file.json
```  
  For example, something like:
```
    npm run adminticket -- -H 192.168.56.101 -o test/local/ticket.json	#or
    bin/adminticket mychips.mydomain.com -o test/tmp/ticket.json
```  
  Make sure the host address matches what is on the web certificate you built
  using the "npm run init" or "npm run cert" commands.
  (See [here](use-pki.md) for more detailed info on this.)
  
- Use the "Import Keys:" option in the connection dialog to open the ticket file.
  You may also drag/drop your ticket file onto the Import button.
  
  Double click on the imported ticket to initiate your connection.
  You should now be prompted for your username (admin).
  The username is purposely not included in the ticket file as a security measure.  
  The user has to know what user the ticket is intended for.
  
  If the ticket is recognized, the GUI should connect to the backend, and promote
  the ticket to a connection key.  Note, the token can only be used once and it
  expires fairly quickly.  If you fail to connect, you may have to issue a new
  ticket (which will automatically invalidate the previous one).  The connection key
  will be good until the admin creates a new connection token for that user.

  The system should next prompt you for a pass-phrase.  This phrase will be used
  when storing your connection key in the browser local storage so others with
  access to your computer can't steal your key.  Leave it blank if you don't want
  to encrypt your key (bad idea in a production environment).

  You should then also export your key and save it in a safe place.  You can
  use this same key in other browsers or to restore your connection if you lose
  or clear your local storage.  If you lose the admin key, you will have to 
  reissue a connection token using the procedure above.  The admin user can issue
  connection tokens for other users using the admin GUI.
  
### URL Tickets:
(The easier way)  
  It is also possible using the -Q switch to make adminticket produce a URL which
  you can connect to directly, eliminating the need to import a key file into the
  UI as described above.
```
    bin/adminticket -Q
```
  Then copy the output of this program and paste it into your browser location bar.
  This should connect you to the server.

  You may like to do this in one step with Something like:
```  
    chrome $(bin/adminticket -Q)
```  
  See the documentation in the wylib package for more detailed information on 
  how connection keys work.
