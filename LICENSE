MyCHIPs License Agreement
Version 3, Jul 12, 2020

(For a non-binding, common language summary, please see the file: FREE-USE)

The Got Choices Foundation, Owner of the MyCHIPs package contained herein, 
grants a dual License to the programs, code, files, algorithms, API's, 
documentation and other content in this package, hereinafter "the Software," 
such that The Software may be used according to one of the two Options desribed 
below.

For purposes of this License, the term "CHIP Trader" shall mean any individual
or organization who uses the Software to establish and/or conduct a credit 
relationship, a "Tally," with another individual or organization.  The term 
"Service Provider" shall mean any individual or organization who uses the 
Software to host an account for one or more CHIP Traders.  The term "Revenue"
shall mean any accrual, pledge, or receipt of value, whether measured in CHIPs 
or some other unit, which is received in connection with the use of the 
Software.

Free Option:
You may use The Software according to the GNU Affero General Public License 
Version 3, a copy of which is included in this distribution (AGPL-3.0), subject 
to the following two conditions, which constitute binding amendments to that
license:

  Condition 1: CHIP Traders incorporate into all their Tallies and hence, their
    transactions, the terms and conditions referenced in contracts/Free.yaml, 
    and further agree that such terms and conditions supercede any additional 
    terms and conditions they may agree to as part of those Tallies and 
    transactions.  This obligation pertains to the version of Free.yaml 
    published with the version of the Software being used at such time as a 
    given Tally is agreed to; and
    
  Condition 2: Service Providers
    A) take commercially reasonable measures to inform the CHIP Traders of 
       their obligations under this License, most notably Condition 1 above; 
       and
    B) proactively collect, and remit monthly to the Owner, any payments due, 
       as explained below, from those who do not abide by Condition 1.
    C) deal honestly with, and representing the best interests of, the CHIP
       Traders they host services for and exchange credits with, whether
       directly or indirectly.

Paid Option:
Service Providers and CHIP Traders using the Software who do not abide by the 
Conditions above automatically become subject to the Paid Option and agree to
remit to the Owner:

  A) 1% of all gross Revenues associated directly or indirectly with the use 
     of The Software, remitted voluntarily and monthly to, and without explicit 
     invoice or demand by, the Owner; and
  B) An additional 9% of all such revenues, plus all associated collection 
     costs, including attorneys fees, in such case that the 1% royalty payments 
     noted above are not made timely or otherwise require collection efforts by 
     the Owner or its agents; furthermore
  C) Should a Service Provider have intentionally cheated or defrauded a CHIP
     Trader, then the Service Provider, in addition to the fees due under
     subsections (A) and (B) above, shall be liable for the greater of $5000 
     USD or 300% of any resulting loss by the CHIP Trader, plus collection 
     costs and attorney's fees.  The Owner hereby assigns this claim to any
     CHIP Trader so harmed by a Service Provider pursuant to this subsection
     (C) for purposes of suing and collecting on the Owner's claim provided
     the CHIP Trader shall, as a condition of said assignment, remit 10% of the
     gross recover amounts to the Owner.

All proceeds collected from the Paid Option, or resulting from damage claims, 
shall be used by the Owner for the advancement of the stated purpose of the
Owner as defined in its governing documents.
