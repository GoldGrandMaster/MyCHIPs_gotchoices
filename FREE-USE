This file explains in a simpler, but not contractual way, how end users can use 
the MyCHIPs software contained in this repository for free.  For the legally 
binding version, please see the file: LICENSE.

It is pretty simple:  Always incorporate the contract clauses referenced in:

  ./contract/Free.json

into your transactions.  And then don't add anything else to your contracts 
that would water down these terms or invalidate them.

At its essence, this means two things:

1. Use the standard CHIP definition:
   - You will only use MyCHIPs software to exchange CHIPs, as defined in the
     software distribution.  
   - For example, you won't come up with your own tally contracts to trade 
     government currency or any other equity, commodity or unit of value.
   - And you won't try to redefine what a CHIP is in your tallies.

2. You will conduct yourself honestly in your trades:
   - For example, don't try to steal value or fool people into giving it to 
     you on terms they would not otherwise knowingly agree to.
   - Take reasonable care that your trading partners are competent to
     understand the transaction and are dealing with you of their own free 
     will and choice.
   - When you make a pledge, do everything in your power to honor it.

If you don't want to abide by these terms, you might still be able to use the 
software.  But you are not entitled to do so for free.  Please contact the
Owner using the contact form at gotchoices.org if you need a custom license.
