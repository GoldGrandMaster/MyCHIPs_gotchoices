	- mc_admin issues tickets.
	- mc_mobi connects to mc_user, validates the ticket, exchanges keys.

Pre	2017-Mar
	- Initial framework prototyped in Ruby.
	- Includes peer server for communicating with other servers.
	- User server will answer requests from a user agent, such as a cell
	  phone application.  But for now, it is just a command line interface.

Pre	2017-Jan
	- Blank project.
	- The hope is to attract some other team members by posting the project 
	  objectives.
