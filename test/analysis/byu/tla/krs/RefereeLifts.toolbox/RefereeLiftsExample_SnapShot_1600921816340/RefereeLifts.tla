\*MyCHIPs payments and lifts specification module.
\*Copyright MyCHIPs.org; See license in root of this package
\* -------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Specifies voluntary payments, payments of invoices, circular and linear
\* lifts. Assumes that each user is hosted at its individual site. Includes
\* an example of malicious behavior when at the lift proposal phase
\* a non-originator user reduces (in magnitude) the value in the pending
\* chit being added to their stock tally and sends the query/terminus
\* message with this reduced value to the foil peer.

ASSUME
    /\ Links \subseteq Users \X Users \* Links are a pair of users (user, user)
    /\ \A link \in Links: link[1] # link[2] \* Links don't connect to self (userA, userB) A != B

NextIndexIn(i, ring) == (i % Len(ring)) + 1  \* 1 indexed between 1 and length

PrevIndexIn(i, ring) == ((i - 2) % Len(ring)) + 1 \* -2 +1 to get correctly in 1 ... len
\* not sure why this is not 0 indexed. I assume personal preferences

ASSUME \A cycle \in Cycles: \* for all cycles
    /\ \A i \in 1..Len(cycle): cycle[i] \in Users \* cycles are containers of only users
    /\ \A i, j \in 1..Len(cycle): i # j => cycle[i] # cycle[j] \* no user appears twice in the cycle (this may be invalid)
    /\ \A i \in 1..Len(cycle): <<cycle[i], cycle[NextIndexIn(i, cycle)]>> \in Links \* every item in the cycle is linked with the next item
    \* need to ensure Links is symmetric

ASSUME \A polyline \in Polylines:
    /\ \A i \in 1..Len(polyline): polyline[i] \in Users \* polylines are containers of only users
    /\ \A i, j \in 1..Len(polyline): i # j => polyline[i] # polyline[j] \* no user appears twice in a polyline (this may be invalid)
    /\ \A i \in 1..(Len(polyline) - 1): <<polyline[i], polyline[i + 1]>> \in Links \* evry item in line is connected with next
    /\ <<polyline[Len(polyline)], polyline[1]>> \notin Links \* The end of the line is not linked with the begining

ASSUME PaymentsRange \in {range \in SUBSET Nat: \E min, max \in 1..999: min <= max /\ range = min..max}
\* PaymentsRange is a range of numbers with min at least 1 and max at most 999.

ASSUME PaymentsCount \in Int \*Payments Count is some integer (could be negative... why?)

ASSUME
    /\ LinearLiftsCount \in Int \* Linear Lifts Count is some integer
    /\ LinearLiftsCount >= 0 \* that cannot be negative

NextElemIn(elem, ring) == \*syntactic sugar to get next element in cycle using User not index
    LET I == CHOOSE i \in 1..Len(ring): ring[i] = elem
    IN ring[NextIndexIn(I, ring)]

    LET I == CHOOSE i \in 1..Len(ring): ring[i] = elem

RECURSIVE Sum(_)
Sum(f) ==
    IF DOMAIN f = {} THEN \* if there are no items left in the domain of the query
        0 \*the sum is 0
    ELSE \*otherwise
        LET X == CHOOSE x \in DOMAIN f: TRUE \* X is a function that returns an index to an arbitrary item in f
        IN f[X] + Sum([y \in DOMAIN f \ {X} |-> f[y]]) \* Add the arbitrary item to the Sum of f excluding X
        \* y is a domain that has all of f except X. y is a set. f[y] is the set of all items excluding X.
\* Summary. Recursivly selects an item in f and adds it to the sum of f excluding that item


\* 3 is a magic number here. I believe it has to do with the data structure of tallies
TalliesOfType(type) == [id \in {id \in DOMAIN tallies: id[3] = type} |-> tallies[id]] \* gets all tallies of a given type

FoilTallies == TalliesOfType(Foil) \* convinence to get all foils
StockTallies == TalliesOfType(Stock) \* convinence to get all Stocks

ProjectedBalance(tally) ==
    LET ValidChitIndexes == {i \in DOMAIN tally.chits: tally.chits[i].state \in {Good, Pend}} \* get all chits in tally that are good or pending
    IN Sum([i \in ValidChitIndexes |-> tally.chits[i].value]) \* sum their total value (chit values can be positve or negative?)

FoilsProjectedBalances == [id \in DOMAIN FoilTallies |-> ProjectedBalance(tallies[id])] \* sums projected balance of all foils in system
StocksProjectedBalances == [id \in DOMAIN StockTallies |-> ProjectedBalance(tallies[id])] \* sums projected balance of all stocks in system 

AvailableBalance(tally) ==
    LET GoodChitIndexes == {i \in DOMAIN tally.chits: tally.chits[i].state = Good} \* get all chits in tally that are good
    IN Sum([i \in GoodChitIndexes |-> tally.chits[i].value]) \* sum the total value

FoilAvailableBalances == [id \in DOMAIN FoilTallies |-> AvailableBalance(tallies[id])] \* sums available balance of all foils in system
StocksAvailableBalances == [id \in DOMAIN StockTallies |-> AvailableBalance(tallies[id])] \* sums available balance of all stocks in system

AddChit(tally, chit) == [tally EXCEPT !.chits = Append(@, chit)] \* returns an objectf equal to tally except that tally.chits = Append(tally.chits, chit)
\*Append is a tla language function that appends an item to a list

UpdateChit(tally, chitType, guidFieldName, guid, state) == \* updates the state of a chit with the given properties
    [tally EXCEPT !.chits =
        [i \in DOMAIN tally.chits |-> \* for all chits in the given tally
            [tally.chits[i] EXCEPT !.state = \* return a chit equal to the chit in the tally except that the state is changed to
                IF
                    /\ tally.chits[i].type = chitType \* if the type matches the search
                    /\ tally.chits[i][guidFieldName] = guid \* and the arbitrary property (guidFieldName) matches the seearch
                THEN
                    state \* set the state to the provided state
                ELSE
                    tally.chits[i].state]]] \* set the state to the existing state (don't make a change)

UpdateLiftChit(tally, liftGuid, state) == UpdateChit(tally, LiftType, "liftGuid", liftGuid, state) \* syntactic sugar

UpdatePaymentChit(tally, paymentGuid, state) == UpdateChit(tally, PaymentType, "paymentGuid", paymentGuid, state) \* syntactic sugar

\* Message(msg) == msg @@ "rcvTimer" :> RandomElement(TransmitTime[{msg.from, msg.to}]) 
\* Take the msg you give me and add a new mapping that maps "recTimer" to a random amount of time
 
Values(f) == {f[x]: x \in DOMAIN f} \* the set defined by f[x] where x is in the domain of f (to convert a list to set?)

Min(s) == CHOOSE x \in s: \A y \in s: y >= x \* returns an arbitrary min value (there could be more then one)

Max(s) == CHOOSE x \in s: \A y \in s: y <= x \* returns an arbitrary max value (there could be more then one)

\* gets the minimum stock or foil balance along the route (assumes no one will want to have a postive foil or negative stock)
MaxLiftValueFor(route, balance(_)) == Min( \* takes a route (cycle?) and a function named balance that takes one argument
    Values([stockId \in {id \in DOMAIN tallies: \* get the set of balances for all stocks in the route
        \* the set of stockIds where a stockId is some id in tallies
        \E i \in DOMAIN route: <<route[i], route[PrevIndexIn(i, route)], Stock>> = id} 
        \* where we connect backwards in the route and it is of "Stock" type
            |-> balance(tallies[stockId])]) \union \* call balance on each of those stock ids and make the set
    \* union the set of stock balances with the set of foil balances
    Values([foilId \in {id \in DOMAIN tallies: \* get the set of all balances for all the foils in the route
        \E i \in DOMAIN route: <<route[i], route[NextIndexIn(i, route)], Foil>> = id}
            |-> -balance(tallies[foilId])])) \* negate the foil balances to get a positive number

(*** Initial State ***)

Init ==
    /\ tallies = [id \in UNION {{<<x, y, Foil>>, <<y, x, Stock>>}: <<x, y>> \in Links} |-> [chits |-> <<>>]]
    \* tallies is a map that maps tuples <<x, y, Foil>> or <<y, x, Stock>> where x is linked to y to a record that maps chits to empty tuples
    \* eg tallies[a, b, Foil] maps to an empty list if a links with b. (Creates an empty holding place to hold chits, i.e a tally)
    /\ lifts = [user \in Users |-> [liftGuid \in {} |-> 0]]
    \* maps all users to an item in the empty set (what does that mean?) which (a big empty map?) TODO understand this better
    /\ messages = EmptyBag \* a bag is a set that can contain duplicates
    /\ paymentsRemaining = PaymentsCount \* paymentsRemaining is initalized to Payments Count
    /\ linearLiftsRemaining = LinearLiftsCount \* ^...
    /\ nextGuid = 101 \* unique identifier implemented as a count (start at 101 to avoiod collisions?)
    /\ _stateNum = 1 \* count to get unique state ids 
    /\ Print("Init", _stateNum) = 1 \*print statements return 1 when successful for status
