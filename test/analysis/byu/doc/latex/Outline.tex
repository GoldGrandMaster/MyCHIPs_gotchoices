Abstract vibe. Credit clearing lift protocol.
Properties.

We have proven these properties hold in a 4 node system using model checking. But we need to make a claim about any number of nodes in any type of topology. 

Thesis
We claim that we can prove this in coq.

Background Describe in Detail the Lift Protocol

Plan of Work
Sliding window abstraction to prove the properties hold with an arbitrary typologies and number of nodes. Why I believe it captures this. 

Validation
Change the protocol in X Y Z ways and expect the proof to fail.
