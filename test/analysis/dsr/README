In early 2020, the code was just starting to demonstrate distributed lifts in 
a simulated network of users.

Soon thereafter, DSR Corporation (https://en.dsr-corporation.com/contact-us) 
was retained to conduct a study of the proposed lift algorithm and protocol, 
according to the working specification at the time and, as well as could be 
determined, the software implementation so far.  Of particular interest was 
whether the protocol suffered from safety and/or liveness issues.

The deliverable for that analysis is in the phase-1 folder.  The study
revealed several issues related to tradeoffs between safety and liveness.
Specifically, there was no clear way to assure both at the same time.  Based
on this study, it seems evident the protocol will need to be improved in
some way.
