In getting the docker simulation to run, the DSR staff made changes to these 
files which are found in test/sim.  Setting the viewer to "xterm" should have 
been done in local/config.dock.  

The other issues have to do with the way the docker images are built.  For
example, the image for the "devel" container was originally built without its 
own static copy of the mychips app (in the /app dir).

When the images are launched, they mount the local mychips folder on 
/usr/local/devel and use that rather than the /app folder.  This makes it so
any changes to the code will get invoked right away, without having to rebuild
the image.

However, DSR had trouble with this and suggested the changes.  Pending results
from others who also may have trouble with the simulation, some or all of 
these changes may need to be considered more closely.
